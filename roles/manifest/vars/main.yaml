# This file describes links and versions for the different components,
# which are used in this configuration.
# It is important to pin specific versions to ensure reproducibility.
#
# Most of the packages follow predicable patterns with arch and package formats.
# This is very useful, since it allows to compactly write down the url with some ansible templating.
# An update procedure is also aware of these simple patterns.
# Some packages, however, do not have predicable URL patterns.
# Writing an update procedure, which would adapt for complex templating, is cumbersome.
# To overcome this, here we use a two-staged manifest variable, which works according to the following rules:
# 1. If the component has a predicable URL pattern, include it directly into the `manifest` variable.
#    Essentially, we have written several different URLs with one templated entry.
#    Update procedure is following simple patterns and is able to update such entry.
#    Playbook tasks will be able to reference this entry directly without disambiguating different
#    variants themselves.
# 2. If the component does not have a predicable URL pattern, explicitly "expand" it into the several
#    variants in the `manifest_pre` variable.
#    These variants must follow simple patterns and will be updated one-by-one by the update procedure.
#    The final complex-templated variable should be included in the `manifest` variable and
#    it will not be touched by the update procedure.
